# Cyclist_project
Cyclistic's marketing strategy was to build general awareness and appeal to broader consumer segments. The introduction of flexible pricing plans was one approach that helped make these things possible. Pricing plans ranged from single-ride and full-day passes to annual memberships. Customers purchasing single-ride or full-day passes are called casual riders. Customers buying annual memberships are called Cyclistic members.

Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers than usual, Lily Moreno, the marketing director, believes that expanding the number of annual members will be critical to future growth. Cyclistic's finance analysts have also concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Rather than creating a marketing campaign targeting all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders already know the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

ASK
Moreno has tasked the marketing analytics team to design effective strategies to maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders of Cyclistic into yearly members. Three questions will guide the marketing analytics team:

1.How do annual members and casual riders differ regarding Cyclistic bike usage?

2.Why would casual riders buy the Cyclistic annual membership?

3.How can digital media influence casual riders of Cyclistic to become annual members?

Description
Only data from the previous twelve months, i.e., from AUGUST 2022 to JULY 2023, will be used for this project.

After downloading the source zip files, the first step is to create a folder with appropriate file names. Each dataset was a CSV (comma-separated values) file. However, the preferred format for data imports and exports is UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) encoded CSV format. This encoding supports many special characters, like hieroglyphs and accented characters, and is backward compatible with ASCII. Therefore, we will save each file as a CSV UTF-8 (comma delimited) file in a separate folder. Placing the original dataset and the files we will use in different folders is a cautionary measure not to mix up datasets.

Credibility of data
The credibility and integrity of our data can be determined using the ROCCC system.

The data is reliable — it has a large sample size, reflecting the population size.

The data is original — we can locate the primary source.

The data is comprehensive — it is understandable and does not contain any missing critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution, nor does it have human error.

The data is current — it is relevant and up to date, thus indicating that the source refreshes its data regularly.

The data is cited — the source has been vetted.

The data integrity and credibility are sufficient to provide reliable and comprehensive insights for the team's analysis.

Limitations
Data privacy issues prohibit using riders' personally identifiable information such as gender and age. Unfortunately, this means we cannot connect pass purchases to credit card numbers and determine a few identifiers, e.g., if casual riders live in areas with Cyclistic services available or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
